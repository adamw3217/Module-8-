The document outlines a coding assignment focused on checksum verification using the SHA-256 algorithm cipher to ensure the integrity and verification of a public key. 
This process is crucial for maintaining security, as SHA-256 reduces the chances of hash collisions, ensuring that each file remains unique and secure. 
The assignment includes submitting refactored code and a document for review, indicating the emphasis on practical application and understanding of cryptographic security principles. 
This exercise highlights the importance of secure coding practices, the addition of security layers, and the continuous assessment of vulnerabilities to maintain software security. 
It demonstrates the student's ability to apply security concepts in coding, which is valuable for future employers looking for skills in developing and maintaining secure software applications.
